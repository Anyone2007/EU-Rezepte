------------------------------------------------------

*Preparation*

Step 1
First, wash your tomatoes thoroughly and dry them. Then itâ€™s the turn of the basil.
Wash it and shake it dry. Peel both of your onions and then cut them into even rings.
Peel the garlic clove in the same way, but cut it into fine cubes. Rinse the celery briefly, remove the end pieces and cut it into fine rings.

Step 2
Halve the yellow and red tomatoes. Remove the basil leaves from the stems.
You can either leave these whole or tear them apart later if the leaves are too big for you.

Step 3
Put some olive oil in a non-stick pan and heat it up. Cut your ciabatta into cubes and fry it in the pan until it's nice and crispy.
Sprinkle some more salt over it and put it in a large salad bowl.

Step 4
Throw in your tomatoes, onions and garlic. Mix everything well.
Now add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar over it, season everything with salt, pepper and a little sugar and mix it again.
Add the basil leaves, stir them in and serve your delicious panzanella. Fits perfectly as a side dish!
