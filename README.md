Welcome ! Here you can upload all sustainable recipes from all over Europe and share them with others to imitate :) 
Here you can also find sustainable recipes from others, just take a look around.

Our goal is to show others the possibilities of self-cultivation. In the comments of your recipe you can tell others what experiences you have had with self-cultivation or other things. The comment bar is of course open to everyone so that you can exchange ideas with others about the recipes and other things.

In this way, everyone helps to secure the food supply for all of us. It also helps the climate because we don't have to rely on long trade routes and we can easily grow a lot of things ourselves, without any additives or pesticides.

So? What are you waiting for? Click in and tell others about your experiences ;)
